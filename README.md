# Hello There!

This repo is my personal portfolio website. 

Use it here: [here] (https://www.nanuwar.me/)

This was built with React, GSAP and Tailwind CSS. 

The website features a custom Dock, Draggable Windows and smooth animations. 

## What's Next?
- Making a Webform for the Contacts Page
- Switching 'Hello World!' to different languages, to represent the countries I've lived in (using SVG)
- (Hopefully, somehow) Make the time automatically tick without refreshing
- Implement Minimise and Expand for Windows
- Implement a Gallery and Safari section
